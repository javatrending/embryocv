## Welcome to the documentation for EmbryoCV - an open-source Python package for the analysis of video describing embryonic development

### What is EmbryoCV?
EmbryoCV is a Python package developed to quantify different biological aspects of developing organisms from video datasets. The package EmbryoCV was developed to analyse the large long-term image datasets acquired using an open-source video microscope OpenVIM www.openvim.org. OpenVIM can generate high quality long-term video datasets of large numbers of aquatic embryos for extended periods of time. Consequently OpenVIM is a powerful tool for visualising and quanitfying the dynamic period of embryonic development in a way that is simply not possible with manual observation. 

However, the downside of this capability is the generation of vast quantities of video data and the extremely time consuming aspect of manual analysis. It therefore becomes necessary to quanitfy only particular aspects of biological development, or to limit the scale of experiments for methodological, rather than biological reasons. EmbryoCV is the solution to this issue. It provides a high-throughput pipeline for measuring phenome-level responses of aquatic embryos with unprecedented temporal, spatial and functional resolution.
